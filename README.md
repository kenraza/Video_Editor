# Video_Editor
This project uses a Python to download Youtube videos specified in the list_scenes.json to a a scenes folder and numbers each video from 1 to however
many videos were downloaded. Then python accesses the scenes folder and edits each video to a specified length. Then the clips are complied and python downloads 
the final_video.mp4
The Converter_videotoaudio python file in this project was used to turn a video file(.mp4) to an audio file(.mp3).
Both of these python files use the same list_scenes.json to specify Youtube videos to download and then Edit. 
The list_scene.json needs to be edited everytime in order to specify which Youtube Video needs to be downloaded.
